# League Chat
This program allows users to login and use the League of Legends chat server without having to use the default client.
The advantages are:
  1) Not having to patch in order to speak to friends
  2) Smaller process, should help free up memory that would otherwise be used in the default client
  3) Customizable features coming soon (Change color theme, fonts, text sizes, notifications)
